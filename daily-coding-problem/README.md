# Daily Coding Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the problems sent by https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/.

## Conventions

Since the solutions could be in multiple languages the convention to naming the problem solutions is to name the file with each solution as `pXXXX.ext`, whereas `XXXX` is the problem number with fixed number of digits, e.g. `0021` for problem 21, and `ext` is the language extension.

## Problems

The problems that there is at least a solution in one of the languages.

### Problem `#1` - Easy

Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return `true` since `10 + 7` is `17`.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

### Problem `#80` - Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. For example, in the following tree, return `d`.

```
       a
     / \
    b  c
   /
  d
```
